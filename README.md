Agent Syndicate Burly Brawl Game Demo
The Cliff Notes (Short Version) Re-skin the Burly Brawl Scene from Path of Neo (ps2). Playable game built with unreal engine.

**The longer version:**

The idea is to make a playable game demo. I'm looking for a gameplay style like the burly brawl from the Matrix reloaded/PON.
This is also a recreation of the Matrix Reloaded scene, just after the Oracle & Seraph leave, where Neo & Agent Smith fight in Debir Court during the sequel. But instead of Neo as the main Character I want Keanu to be substituted or 're-skinned' with a hulk sized "Agent Rayment",

In the Agent Syndicate webcomic they are identical twins, but in the proposed game demo, these twins combine to make one Hulk Sized Super Exile/Agent. This is the user, or playable character (Neo substitute).

Instead of fighting Smith clones, the enemies should be random NPCs. The NPCs should explode into green code when they are defeated.

All fighting should be hand to hand melee combat, perhaps Agent Rayment could grab poles out of the ground like we see Neo using the pole as a weapon in Reloaded.

One tricky game play detail, I'd want the player to be able to combine the twins to make the hulk version, but if they separate or undo hulk mode, making them separate twins again, then the health would slowly regenerate and the NPC bots wouldn't be able to attack them while they appear as non hostile twins. The twins would not be able to attack, or be attacked in this state to allow health regeneration.
